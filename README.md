This application, Acrolect, allows students to communicate and be tutored by teachers away from school. This will give the opportunity to expand students' knowledge of writing and enhance the learning environment of students. With the on going contraversy whether or not the teacher salary is appropriate, it is important that teachers are given the option to go into the private sector. With that in mind, I have created an English application that enhances the e-learning sector, allowing teachers to communicate with students and help them understand the course content online. 

PS. I forgot to push my edits to github, wasn't planning on doing it now that it's past 3:00pm but, if you want to see the one wiht edits let me know because I didn't want the time stamps to get all messed up and like finding the older version is a pain. Tried branching it as you can tell but, I sorta gave up on that so, I'm leaving the message here. Hope the "Updated" time stamp on github doesn't misslead you. I did not edit anything else. Please consider not failing me.
