This application, Acrolect, allows students to communicate and be tutored by teachers away from school. This will give the opportunity to expand students' knowledge of writing and enhance the learning environment of students. With the on going contraversy whether or not the teacher salary is appropriate or not, it is important that teachers are given the option to go into the private sector. With that in mind, I have created an English application that enhances the e-learning sector, allowing teachers to communicate with students and help them understand the course content online.
